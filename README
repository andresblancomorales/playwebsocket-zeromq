Play Framework WebSocket + ZeroMQ Bridge
=================================

ZeroMQ socket type: Pull.
The ZeroMQ URI is hardcoded in WebSocketSupervisor to: tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

To test run ./activator run and it will launch a server on http://127.0.0.1:9000

Connect to the websocket using your own client or test with: http://www.websocket.org/echo.html

Connect to ws://127.0.0.1:9000/{whateveryouwant}

Then send a message to a push ZeroMQ socket to: tcp://127.0.0.1:5555 and the message will be forwarded to your client only if your message is exactly {whateveryouwant}.

I wanted to test message forwarding to specific clients and not broadcast it.
